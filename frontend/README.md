# Frontend 


## src Repo Structure
- common (location for images, stylesheets, and components that can be used on multiple pages, a styled button for example)
- pages (each page is made within its respective folder, served from its index.jsx, feel free to create multiple jsx files under this repo for clarity)
- App.js (main app file, most changes should be a new route for a new page)
- index.js (React entry point)
